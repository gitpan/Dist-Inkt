NAME
    Dist::Inkt - yet another distribution builder

STATUS
    Experimental.

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla didn't have the prerequisite amount of crazy for me, so I
    wrote this instead.

    Dist::Inkt itself does virtually nothing; it creates an empty directory,
    generates a MANIFEST file, and then wraps it all up into a gzipped
    tarball. But it provides various hooks along the way for subclasses to
    grab hold of. So the general idea is that you write a subclass of
    Dist::Inkt, which consumes various Moose::Roles to do the actual work of
    populating the distribution with files.

    As such, Dist::Inkt is not so much a distribution builder, as it is a
    framework for writing your own distribution builder.

    Several roles of varying utility are bundled with Dist::Inkt, as is
    Dist::Inkt::Profile::Simple, a subclass of Dist::Inkt which consumes most
    of these roles.

COMPANIONS
    Dist::Inkt does just one thing - building the tarball from some checkout
    of the repo.

    Although roles could theoretically be written for other tasks, out of the
    box, Dist::Inkt doesn't do any of the following:

    Minting new distributions
        I'm writing a separate tool, Dist::Inktly::Minty for that.

    Test suite running
        Use App::Prove or App::ForkProve.

    CPAN Uploading
        Use CPAN::Uploader.

    Changing the version number across many files
        Use Perl::Version.

    Integration with version control tools
        Just use `hg` or `svn` or `git` of whatever as you normally would.
        None of the files generated by Dist::Inkt should probably be checked
        into your repo.
